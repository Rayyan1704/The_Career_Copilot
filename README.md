The app uses a dark theme by default. Colors are defined in `src/app/globals.css` using HSL values:

- Background: `0 0% 3.9%` (Very dark gray)
- Foreground: `0 0% 98%` (Almost white)
- Primary: `0 0% 98%` (For primary elements)
- Secondary: `0 0% 14.9%` (For secondary UI elements)
- Muted: `0 0% 63.9%` (For descriptions and placeholder text)

### Typography
- Headlines: Space Grotesk font
- Body text: Inter font

## API Configuration

The application uses Google AI (Gemini) through Genkit for all AI-powered features. Make sure to:

1. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add it to your `.env.local` file
3. The API key should have access to Gemini models

## File Support

- **PDF**: Client-side extraction using pdfjs-dist
- **DOCX**: Server-side extraction using Genkit flow with Gemini
- **TXT**: Direct file reading

## Development

### CSS Linting Notes
The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with modern directives like `@theme`, `@custom-variant`, and `@apply`. If you see CSS linting warnings about "unknown at-rules", these are expected and can be safely ignored. The VS Code settings in `.vscode/settings.json` are configured to suppress these warnings.

### Adding New Tools
1. Create a new page in `src/app/[tool-name]/page.tsx`
2. Add the tool to the navigation in `src/components/app-header.tsx`
3. Add the tool card to the main dashboard in `src/app/page.tsx`
4. Create corresponding Genkit flows in `src/lib/flows/`
5. Add server actions in `src/lib/actions.ts`

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
## AI-Assisted Development

This project was ideated and implemented with the assistance of AI development tools, including Kiro and Gemini, to accelerate coding and debugging.  
While AI helped generate parts of the code and boilerplate, all design decisions, integrations, testing, and final refinements were directed and validated by me.

This reflects my ability to leverage AI productively in modern software development workflows — a key skill for the future of AI engineering.
